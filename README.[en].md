# Joint OSPO @ DIN-DKE

| Deutsch / German  | ***[Link](README.md)*** 	         |


[DIN](https://www.din.de/) and [DKE](https://www.dke.de/) are expanding their current product range with regard to the integration of open-source solutions. This platform offers open-source solutions based on the resolutions of the FOCUS.ICT-TF.

The Joint OSPO is a joint initiative of DIN and VDE DKE with the following tasks:

- Supporting and advising DIN and DKE committees on needs in the open source area;
- Networking with open-source organisations and communities;
- Supporting and advising open-source organisations and communities on standardisation needs.

The Joint OSPO @ DIN-DKE takes on the following tasks:
- Strengthening visibility in the open-source area through internal and external communication;
- Conceptual further development of open-source software in the standardisation environment with regard to IPR, governance, licences, business models etc.;



## Introduction
Many companies, including those which are active in standardisation, already use open-source software and participate in open-source projects. Open-source software makes it easy to spread the risk and costs of complex innovation projects over many shoulders. Smaller companies in particular can thus participate in a distributed innovation process and the resulting network effects in the first place.
On platforms like GitHub, for example, collaborative work is done in the software sector, which enables a fast path from innovative development to deployment. This model can be used by standardisation organisations such as DIN and DKE to provide additional content in the form of open-source software on standards and norms.

Today documents and the formats of current standards are very diverse. Technical information in the form of metadata or (reproducible) source code also serves the purpose of standards. Best practice in software development is a not insignificant part of this "new" standardisation. Open-source projects also enable rapid implementation through agile working methods and the possibility of involving all participants in the development process at an early stage. Certain standards, such as interfaces and protocols, are already developed in open source, whereby the code itself can function as a standard or form part of the standard. It is precisely with these subsets that synergies exist between the open-source community and the standardisation organisations such as DIN and DKE.


## European and international developments
CEN/CENELEC and the Digital and Information Technology Strategy Advisory Group (DITSAG) are already making intensive efforts to develop solutions in the area of open source. With DIN as project leader of "Project 4 - Open Source Solutions", there is a good interface to DIN and DKE. Consistent networking between national and European activities is thus easy to realise. 
Key strategic issues are stakeholder engagement, technical solutions, processes and business models. By the end of 2022, a first framework for the inclusion of open source in standardisation is expected to be developed here.

In addition, the European Commission already has the topic of open source on its agenda and will increasingly use open-source solutions in the future. In October 2020, a new Open-Source Software Strategy 2020-2023 was adopted. The strategy "Think Open" strategy is concerned with fostering the innovative and collaborative power of open source and promoting the sharing and re-use of software solutions, knowledge and expertise to deliver better European services (https://ec.europa.eu/germany/news/20201021-strategie-open-source_de). Preparatory activities for this included the JRC study "The Relationship Between Open-Source Software and Standard Setting" (https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC117836).
Apart from the "ISO/IEC 5230:2020 Information technology - OpenChain Specification", it is currently unclear how intensive ISO/IEC's activities are in the area of open source. The OpenChain Specification is not an original ISO/IEC standard, but a standard developed by various open-source organisations, including the Linux Foundation, which was published as an ISO/IEC standard via the ISO/IEC fast-track approach.



## Generic use cases
The interaction between standardisation on the one hand and open-source solutions on the other hand can take place in different constellations, for which different approaches are also required. The generic use cases described below have been identified. With regard to a possible inclusion in an open-source offering, only the first three use cases mentioned were initially analysed:
### Specification-driven development (standard first)
The specification-driven approach common in traditional standardisation first defines the technical requirements and functionalities before developing products based on them. A distinction must be made between two types of approach:

1. implementation of existing norms and standards in open source, e.g., in the form of reference or test implementations;
2. complementing existing norms and standards with (non-normative) open-source solutions. Examples of this are software platforms on the basis of which the implementation of the actual standard can take place (service layer) or supporting tools such as test or implementation environments.

### Implementation-driven development (Implementation first)
The implementation-driven approach describes the transformation of open-source developments into standards and norms. Mature and proven open-source solutions are thus implemented in standards only afterwards. Examples of this are the programming languages C++ or HTML.

### Parallel development
In this use case, the development of standards and open-source products takes place in parallel within one project. The linking of the two strands is already agreed before the start of the project. This ensures that standardisation is taken into account from the outset in the development process of an open-source product (and vice versa). A transparent exchange of developments is therefore essential for the success of such parallel developments. In this process, standard and open-source product also influence each other, so that it is easy to integrate current findings or changes in the other strand. The integration of inputs from standardisation or open source can lead to results with higher quality and wider dissemination. Examples of this are programming languages and associated compilers.

### Standard under open-source licence
The open-source approach can in principle also be applied to classic standardisation results. In this case, the standard itself is published under an open-source licence. On this basis, a broad community develops proposals for the further development of the standard, which can then be integrated into a new edition by the standardisation committee.
This has already been piloted with the two-part DIN SPEC 3105 Open-Source Hardware. This was developed conventionally, but published under the Creative Commons licence CC-BY-SA 4.0 and is now available on the DIN collaboration platform DIN.ONE for the development of suggestions for improvement.
From today's perspective, such an approach is particularly suitable for the specification of open-source hardware.

### Agile development and maintenance
As a rule, open-source projects are not projects that are completed in time. Although there are "stable", versioned releases of the software, further development and maintenance take place in parallel. In most cases, the paradigm of "agile software development" is applied, which is characterised by short, incremental development steps (so-called "sprints") and frequent publication of new versions. This approach is often subsumed as "release fast, release often".
This approach can also be adapted to the creation of standards. In this context, it plays a subordinate role which of the use cases described above was pursued. This approach is particularly suitable for the accompaniment and support of distributed, highly dynamic innovation processes, because in this way the always up-to-date communication of the secured boundary conditions to all participants can be achieved.
In the case of parallel development, "Agile Standardisation" can lead to a consistent relationship between standardisation and software development, ensuring that the standard evolves synchronously with the open-source solution.
Agile project management has long been best practice in software development and is imperative for optimal interaction between open source and standardisation. An agile approach makes it possible to transfer the corresponding technologies developed in open source to standardisation in cycles that are in line with requirements. Furthermore, an agile approach makes it easier to react to external circumstances or even unexpected deviations in developments. In addition, agile feedback cycles enable the consistent maintenance of norms and standards.
